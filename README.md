## `model_with_other_techniques.ipynb`

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
   - Read Excel files
   - Merge datasets with labels
   - Split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets
   - Normalize the data

2. Model Implementations
   - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
   - Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM)
   - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

3. Model Training and Evaluation
   - Train each model on the preprocessed data
   - Evaluate models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
   - Visualize training history

4. Model Comparison
   - Compare accuracies of all models
   - Visualize comparison using a bar plot

5. Best Model Selection
   - Select the best performing model
   - Save the best model for future use
  
## What's next:
- Add labels to features and target
- Fine tune the models with different learning rates, epochs etc
- Debugging and testing
